    "The `titanic` dataset is widely used in ML courses.  The 'stakeholder problem' is to predict whether or not a person was likely to survive given the available data.  We'll use it here for a few problems to get used to pre-processing. First, let's do some EDA.  Load the data in and use a scatter plot matrix to visualize just the numeric columns.  Look critically at your results.  What have you learned?  What would you like to know that this analysis doesn't tell you?"

Figure out how to use histogram plots to look at survival rates by age, pclass, and gender."
