    "# Preprocessing and Evaluation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous sessions, we explored linear regression and how to implement it using both custom code and sklearn. However, in real-world scenarios, data is rarely clean and ready for modeling. This is where preprocessing comes into play. Additionally, to ensure our models are performing well and generalizing correctly, we need robust evaluation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an overview of key preprocessing and evaluation concepts that we'll explore in depth in the following notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing involves transforming raw data into a format that's more suitable for modeling. Key preprocessing steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Normalization**: Scaling features to a common range to ensure no single feature dominates the model.\n",
    "   - Standard Scaling: Transforming features to have mean=0 and variance=1.\n",
    "   - Min-Max Scaling: Scaling features to a fixed range, usually [0, 1].\n",
    "   - Log Scaling: Not actually a \"normalization\" method per se, but and important step for power law data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Handling Outliers**: Identifying and dealing with extreme values that could skew our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converting non-numeric data into a format our model can understand.\n",
    "   - One-Hot Encoding: Creating binary columns for each category.\n",
    "   - Ordinal Encoding: Assigning integer values to categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Imputation**: Dealing with missing data by filling in values.\n",
    "   - Simple strategies include using the mean, median, or mode of the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation helps us understand how well our model is performing and whether it's likely to generalize to new data. Key concepts include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Metrics**: Quantitative measures of model performance.\n",
    "   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures the standard deviation of residuals.\n",
    "   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors.\n",
    "   - R-squared (RÂ²): Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable predictable from the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Train-Test Split**: Dividing data into separate training and testing sets to assess model performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cross-Validation**: A technique for assessing how well a model will generalize to an independent dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following notebooks, we'll dive deeper into each of these concepts, providing both custom implementations and sklearn-based solutions. We'll also demonstrate how neglecting proper preprocessing can lead to suboptimal model performance.\n"
